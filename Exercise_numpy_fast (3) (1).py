# # Numpy
# 
# Welcome to Numpy a package widely used in the data science community. 
# In this assignment, you will:
# * Learn to use Numpy, a package which let us work efficiently with arrays and matrices in Python.
# 
# 
# #### Why are we using Numpy? 
# 
# * Extra features required by Python :
# * fast, multidimensional arrays
# * libraries of reliable, tested scientiÔ¨Åc functions
# * plotting tools
# * NumPy is at the core of nearly every scientific Python application or module since it provides a fast N-d array datatype that can be manipulated in a vectorized form. 

# ## Load package
# * Let's import Numpy as np. This lets us use the shortcut np to refer to Numpy..

# * T1- Check the numpy version 
#       Hint: methods version.version or __version__

# # **Our first Numpy array. We can start by creating a list and converting in to an array**:

mylist = [1, 2, 3]

# # ** x is our first Numpy array. We can pass the list directly**:

y = np.array([4, 5, 6])
print(Fore.RED + '\nmy second Numpy array', y)


# **Multidimensional arrays by passing in a list of lists.
# (We passed in two lists with three elements each, and we get a two by three array.)**:
#
# * T2- Create a numpy array m  with the vectors: [7, 8, 9] and  [10, 11, 12]
# * T3- Check the dimensions by using the shape attribute
